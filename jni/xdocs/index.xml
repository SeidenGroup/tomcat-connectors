<subsection name="Requirements">
    <p>
      Build tc-native requires three components to be installed:
      <ul>
        <li>APR library</li>
        <li>OpenSSL libraries</li>
        <li>Java SE Development Kit (JDK)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="UNIX">
  <p>
    On all the POSIX systems (Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX etc...) a well-known
    configure and make is used to build tc-native.<br/>
    In the jni/native runs:<br/>
    <pre>
    ./configure --help
    </pre>
    to read the description of all the parameters.<br/>
    <pre>
    ./configure --with-apr=$HOME/APR \
                --with-java-home=$JAVA_HOME \
                --with-ssl=$HOME/OPENSSL \
                --prefix=$HOME/TCNATIVE
    </pre>
    to create the includes and makefiles to be able to build tc-native.<br/>
    Where:<br/>
    $HOME/APR is something like /usr/bin/apr-1-config or the path where apr is
    installed.<br/>
    $JAVA_HOME is something /home/jfclere/JAVA/jdk1.5.0_09 path to a JDK
    installation. Any JDK should work but it is advisable to use the same
    JVM version the JVM you use with Tomcat.<br/>
    $HOME/OPENSSL is the path where openssl is installed.<br/>
    $HOME/TCNATIVE is the path where the produced libraries will be installed.<br/>
    <br/>
    The configure is able to guess most of OpenSSL standard installations.
    So most of the time the following will be enough:
    <pre>
    ./configure --with-apr=/usr/bin/apr-1-config \
                --with-java-home=/home/jfclere/JAVA/jdk1.5.0_09/ \
                --with-ssl=yes \
                --prefix=/home/jfclere/TCNATIVE
    </pre>
    <br/>
    To build the libraries and install them:<br/>
    <pre>
    make &amp;&amp; make install
    </pre>
    The libraries will be found in /home/jfclere/TCNATIVE/lib 
  </p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Windows">
  <p>
   Download the windows sources of tc-native and extract them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Download OpenSSL sources (See <a href="http://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html"><b>Binary Distributions</b></a>)
    OpenSSL is a crypto software so check if you are allowed to download it. If not you can still use tc-native without SSL.
  </p>
  <p>
    Download APR sources for Windows. (See <a href="http://apr.apache.org/download.cgi"><b>Download</b></a>)
    Extract them in jni and rename the apr-1.x.y directory to apr.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use MS Visual Studio to open the workspace of the APR sources and build the library (libapr).
  </p>
  <p>
    Use MS Visual Studio to open the workspace of the tc-native sources, adjust the openssl includes and libraries location
    change the name of the libraries libeay32 and libssleay to libeay32MT and libssleayMT and build the tcn-native library.
    That should create a tcnative-1.dll.
  </p>

<section name="Install and tests">
<subsection name="UNIX">
  <p>
   Edit the $CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.sh and add the path to the tc-native libraries to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
   Something like:
   <pre>
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/jfclere/TCNATIVE/lib
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   /home/jfclere/TCNATIVE/lib
   </pre>
   Start tomcat and check for the messages like is ones:
   <pre>
    Feb 8, 2008 12:27:41 PM org.apache.catalina.core.AprLifecycleListener init
    INFO: Loaded APR based Apache Tomcat Native library 1.1.12.
    Feb 8, 2008 12:27:41 PM org.apache.catalina.core.AprLifecycleListener init
    INFO: APR capabilities: IPv6 [true], sendfile [true], accept filters [false], random [true].
    Feb 8, 2008 12:27:41 PM org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11AprProtocol init
    INFO: Initializing Coyote HTTP/1.1 on http-8080
   </pre>
    Refer to the tomcat documentation to configure the connectors
    (See <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/apr.html">Tomcat6.0.x</a>
    and  <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/apr.html">Tomcat5.5.x</a>)
