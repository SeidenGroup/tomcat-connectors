    <p>
      Build tc-native requires three components to be installed:
      <ul>
        <li>APR library</li>
        <li>OpenSSL libraries</li>
        <li>Java SE Development Kit (JDK)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

<subsection name="UNIX">
  <p>
    On all the POSIX systems (Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX etc...) a well-known
    configure and make is used to build tc-native.<br/>
    In the jni/native runs:<br/>
    <pre>
    ./configure --help
    </pre>
    to read the description of all the parameters.<br/>
    <pre>
    ./configure --with-apr=$HOME/APR \
                --with-java-home=$JAVA_HOME \
                --with-ssl=$HOME/OPENSSL \
                --prefix=$HOME/TCNATIVE
    </pre>
    to create the includes and makefiles to be able to build tc-native.<br/>
    Where:<br/>
    $HOME/APR is something like /usr/bin/apr-1-config or the path where apr is
    installed.<br/>
    $JAVA_HOME is something /home/jfclere/JAVA/jdk1.5.0_09 path to a JDK
    installation. Any JDK should work but it is advisable to use the same
    JVM version the JVM you use with Tomcat.<br/>
    $HOME/OPENSSL is the path where openssl is installed.<br/>
    $HOME/TCNATIVE is the path where the produced libraries will be installed.<br/>
    <br/>
    The configure is able to guess most of OpenSSL standard installations.
    So most of the time the following will be enough:
    <pre>
    ./configure --with-apr=/usr/bin/apr-1-config \
                --with-java-home=/home/jfclere/JAVA/jdk1.5.0_09/ \
                --with-ssl=yes \
                --prefix=/home/jfclere/TCNATIVE
    </pre>
    <br/>
    To build the libraries and install them:<br/>
    <pre>
    make &amp;&amp; make install
    </pre>
    The libraries will be found in /home/jfclere/TCNATIVE/lib
